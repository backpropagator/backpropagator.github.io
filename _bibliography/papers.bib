  abstract={In this work, our objective is to adapt a Deep generative model trained on a large-scale source dataset to multiple target domains with scarce data. Specifically, we focus on adapting a pre-trained Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to a target domain without re-training the generator. Our method draws the motivation from the fact that out-of-distribution samples can be `embedded' onto the latent space of a pre-trained source-GAN. We propose to train a small latent-generation network during the inference stage, each time a  batch of target samples is to be generated. These target latent codes are fed to the source-generator to obtain  novel target samples. Despite using the same small set of target samples and the source generator, multiple independent training episodes of the latent-generation network results in the diversity of the generated target samples. Our method, albeit simple, can be used to generate data from multiple target distributions using a generator trained on a single source distribution. We demonstrate the efficacy of our surprisingly simple method in generating multiple target datasets with only a single source generator and a few target samples.},

  abstract={Class imbalance is a common phenomenon in multiple application domains such as healthcare, where the sample occurrence of one or few class categories is more prevalent in the dataset than the rest. This work addresses the class-imbalance issue by proposing an over-sampling method for the minority classes in the latent space of a Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE). Specifically, we construct a latent space by maximizing the conditional data likelihood using an Encoder-Decoder structure, such that oversampling through convex combinations of latent samples preserves the class identity. A jointly-trained linear classifier that separates convexly coupled latent vectors from different classes is used to impose this property on the AE's latent space. Further, the aforesaid linear classifier is used for final classification without retraining. We theoretically show that our method can achieve a low variance risk estimate compared to naive oversampling methods and is robust to overfitting. We conduct several experiments on benchmark datasets and show that our method outperforms the existing oversampling techniques for handling class imbalance.},

  abstract={In this study, we adapt generative models trained on large source datasets to scarce
target domains. We adapt a pre-trained Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
without retraining the generator, avoiding catastrophic forgetting and over-fitting.
Starting from the observation that target images can be 'embedded' onto the latent
space of a pre-trained source-GAN, our method finds the latent code corresponding
to the target domain on the source latent manifold. Optimizing a latent learner
network during inference generates a novel target embedding that is supplied to
the source-GAN generator to generate target samples. Our method, albeit simple,
can be used to generate data from multiple target distributions using a generator
trained on a single source distribution.},

  title={FadeLoc: Smart Device Localization for Generalized ${\kappa {-} \mu}$ Faded IoT Environment}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={70},
  pages={3206-3220},
  abstract={In this paper, we propose FadeLoc a novel method for localizing smart devices in an Internet of Things (IoT) environment, based on the Received Signal Strength (RSS), and a generic ${\kappa {-} \mu}$ fading model where $\kappa$ and $\mu$ denote the fading parameters. The RSS-based localization is challenging because of noise, fading, and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) effects, thus necessitating an appropriate fading model to best fit the varying RSS values. The advantage of a generic fading model is that it can accommodate all existing fading distributions based on the estimate of $\kappa$ and $\mu$. Hence, the localization can be performed for any fading environment. We derive the maximum likelihood estimate of the smart device location using a generic ${\kappa {-} \mu}$ fading model considering the Large and Small approximations of modified first-order Bessel function and propose an adaptive order selection method with high localization accuracy and faster convergence. We also analyze the convergence of the gradient ascent method for the ${\kappa {-} \mu}$ fading model. The proposed method is evaluated on a simulated ${\kappa {-} \mu}$ fading environment, real outdoor environment, and a complex indoor fading environment. The average localization errors are 2.07 m, 3.5 m, and 0.5 m, respectively, for the three experimental settings, outperforming the state-of-the-art localization methods in the presence of fading.},

    abstract = "{Finding the lineage of a research topic is crucial for understanding the prior state of the art and advancing scientific displacement. The deluge of scholarly articles makes it difficult to locate the most relevant previous work. It causes researchers to spend a considerable amount of time building up their literature list. Citations play a crucial role in discovering relevant literature. However, not all citations are created equal. The majority of the citations that a paper receives provide contextual and background information to the citing papers. In those cases, the cited paper is not central to the theme of citing papers. However, some papers build upon a given paper and further the research frontier. In those cases, the concerned cited paper plays a pivotal role in the citing paper. Hence, the nature of the citation that the former receives from the latter is significant. In this work, we discuss our investigations towards discovering significant citations of a given paper. We further show how we can leverage significant citations to build a research lineage via a significant citation graph. We demonstrate the efficacy of our idea with two real-life case studies. Our experiments yield promising results with respect to the current state of the art in classifying significant citations, outperforming the earlier ones by a relative margin of 20 points in terms of precision. We hypothesize that such an automated system can facilitate relevant literature discovery and help identify knowledge flow for a particular category of papers.}",

  abstract={Wireless fidelity received signal strength (RSS) fingerprints are widely used for localization. However, device heterogeneity and temporal variation in the RSS values are the bottlenecks for accurate localization in the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. This letter addresses these challenges by proposing a novel differential r-vectors which are the device-invariant signature of a particular location and are invariant, even with temporal RSS variations. The proposed network addresses the vanishing gradient problem which occurs in existing deep learning based localization methods, and hence, the localization accuracy improves. We evaluate the proposed method on two real-world datasets comprising device heterogeneity and temporal RSS variations. Additionally, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art fingerprinting-based methods that address these issues.},

  year={2021},
  volume={8},
  number={13},
  pages={10665-10677},
  abstract={Location estimation in an indoor Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment is a challenging task due to multipath signals and obstacles that cause shadowing and fading effects, and change the received signal power considerably. Most of the existing path-loss-based localization methods assume only a lognormal shadowing model and ignore small scale fading effects. This article considers a generic combined lognormal shadowing and Rayleigh fading model for efficient localization of smart devices in an indoor IoT environment. In particular, the maximum likelihood estimate of the location and path-loss exponent (PLE), and Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) are derived. The localization parameters are estimated using a novel adaptive mini-batch gradient ascent method that maximizes the log-likelihood function with an appropriate batch size based on the convergence factor. Hence, the proposed method addresses the challenge of an arbitrary selection of a fixed batch size for a gradient ascent method by utilizing this convergence factor. Performance evaluation by a simulation study and real experiments from an indoor IoT testbed provide a more accurate joint estimation of model parameters and smart device localization.},

  abstract={Location-based services assume significant importance in the Internet of Things (IoT) based systems. In the scenarios where the satellite signals are not available or weak, the Global Positioning System (GPS) accuracy degrades sharply. Therefore, opportunistic signals can be utilized for smart device localization. In this paper, we propose a smart device localization method using residual neural networks. The proposed network is generic and performs smart device localization using opportunistic signals such as Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), geomagnetic, temperature, pressure, humidity, and light signals in the IoT network. Additionally, the proposed method addresses the two significant challenges in IoT based smart device localization, which are noise and device heterogeneity. The experiments are performed on three real datasets of different opportunistic signals. Results show that the proposed method is robust to noise, and a significant improvement in the localization accuracy is obtained as compared to the state-of-the-art localization methods.},

The 3C Citation Context Classification Task organized as part of the Second Workshop on Scholarly Document Processing @ NAACL 2021 is a shared task to address the aforementioned problems. In this paper, we present our team, IITP-CUNI@3C{'}s submission to the 3C shared tasks. For Task A, citation context purpose classification, we propose a neural multi-task learning framework that harnesses the structural information of the research papers and the relation between the citation context and the cited paper for citation classification. For Task B, citation context influence classification, we use a set of simple features to classify citations based on their perceived significance. We achieve comparable performance with respect to the best performing systems in Task A and superseded the majority baseline in Task B with very simple features.",
